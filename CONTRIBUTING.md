We welcome contributions to the **pioneeR** package. To submit a contribution:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/riksrevisjonen/pioneeR/fork) the repository and make your changes.

2. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).


## How to make changes

Before you submit a pull request, please do the following:

* Add an entry to NEWS.md concisely describing what you changed.

* Run Build->Check Package in the RStudio IDE, or `devtools::check()`, to make sure your change did not add any messages, warnings, or errors.

Doing these things will make it easier for the development team to evaluate your pull request. Even so, we may still decide to modify your code or even not merge it at all.

We will try to be responsive and provide feedback in case we decide not to merge your pull request.
